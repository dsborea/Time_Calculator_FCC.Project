# Time_Calculator_FCC.Project

#This was my second project!
#After finishing some courses on Free Code Camp, I decided to watch a tutorial on how to do this project to learn
#It's still incomplete, it runs but won't pass unit tests as of 1/30/23

#This project taught me to look over syntax, naming variables, and how to use the modulo to set limits!
